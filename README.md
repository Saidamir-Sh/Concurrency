# Concurrency

> "Concurrency is a decoupling strategy. It helps us decouple what gets done from when it gets done." - 'Clean Code' by Robert C. Martin 

Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean they will ever both be running at the same instant. For example, multitasking on a single-core machine. However Concurrency is not Parallelism.

In example, Concurrency is two lines of customers ordering from a single cashier (lines take turns ordering); Paralleism is two lines of customers ordering from two cashiers (each line gets its own cashier);
